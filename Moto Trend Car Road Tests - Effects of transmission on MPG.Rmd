## Synopsis

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). We are going to analyze and select the predictors of our dataset by AIC method (Akaike Information Criterion) to regressing the fuel consumption - unit *miles per gallon (MPG)*. 

The questions of our researches are :  

- Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
- Quantifying how different is the MPG between automatic and manual transmissions?
